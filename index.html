            <h2>Conference Preamble</h2>
            <p>Due to the rapid transformations in the energy sector, understanding their impacts on national and global economies has become essential. The current deep changes in the energy industry, driven by technological advancements, fluctuations in supply and demand, and increasing environmental challenges, have prompted many countries to adopt renewable and clean energy sources. This shift fundamentally affects the distribution of economic and political power globally. It underscores the pivotal role of the energy sector in fostering economic growth and its profound impact on economic systems, while also opening up new avenues for challenges and opportunitie.
            In the context of global energy transitions, Algeria emerges as a model that embodies both the challenges and opportunities of this vital transformation. Despite its heavy reliance on the hydrocarbon sector, the country is adopting ambitious strategies to diversify its energy sources, with a particular focus on developing renewable energies, especially solar and wind power. This strategic approach aims to achieve energy security and promote sustainable development while creating new job opportunities as a lever for economic diversification. However, this path faces significant challenges, including the high investment costs for infrastructure and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. All of this necessitates the adoption of effective government policies and the enhancement of international cooperation to support comprehensive energy transition strategies.
            This path holds the potential to bring about structural changes in the national economy by enhancing sustainability and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It also opens promising horizons for innovation and investment, especially for startups in the fields of renewable energy and environmental technologies. This contributes to driving economic growth and creating diverse job opportunities in future-oriented sectors.</p>
